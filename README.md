🤖 baibot is an [AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) ([Large Language Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model)) bot for [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) built by [etke.cc](https://etke.cc/) (managed Matrix servers).

The name is pronounced 'bye'-bot and is a play on [AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence), referencing the fictional character [🇧🇬 Bai Ganyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Ganyo).

It's designed as a more private and [featureful](#-features) alternative to [matrix-chatgpt-bot](https://github.com/matrixgpt/matrix-chatgpt-bot).
It's influenced by [chaz](https://github.com/arcuru/chaz), but does **not** use the [AIChat](https://github.com/sigoden/aichat) CLI tool and instead does everything in-process, without forking.


## 🌟 Features

- 🎨 Encourages **[provider](./docs/providers.md) choice** ([Anthropic](./docs/providers.md#anthropic), [Groq](./docs/providers.md#groq), [LocalAI](./docs/providers.md#localai), [OpenAI](./docs/providers.md#openai), [Venice](./docs/providers.md#venice) and [☁️ many more](./docs/providers.md#️-providers)) as well as **[mixing & matching models](./docs/features.md#-mixing--matching-models)**:

- Supports **different use purposes** (depending on the [☁️ provider](./docs/providers.md) & model):

  - [💬 text-generation](./docs/features.md#-text-generation): communicating with you via text (though certain models may "see" images as well). The [OpenAI provider](./docs/providers.md#openai) also supports [🛠️ built-in tools](./docs/features.md#️-built-in-tools-openai-only) (web search, code interpreter)
  - [🦻 speech-to-text](./docs/features.md#-speech-to-text): turning your voice messages into text
  - [🗣️ text-to-speech](./docs/features.md#%EF%B8%8F-text-to-speech): turning bot or users text messages into voice messages
  - [🖌️ image-generation](./docs/features.md#image-generation): creating and editing images based on instructions

- 🪄 Supports [seamless voice interaction](./docs/features.md#seamless-voice-interaction) (turning user voice messages into text, answering in text, then turning that text back into voice)

- 🦻 Supports [transcribe-only mode](./docs/features.md#transcribe-only-mode) (turning user voice messages into text, without doing text-generation)

- 🗣️ Supports [text-to-speech-only mode](./docs/features.md#text-to-speech-only-mode) (turning user text messages into voice, without doing text-generation)

- 🔒 Supports [encryption](./docs/features.md#-encryption) for Matrix communication and Account-Data-stored configuration

- ♻️ Supports [context-management](./docs/configuration/text-generation.md#️-context-management) for every [provider](./docs/providers.md) (automatically trimming older messages on whole-turn boundaries once a conversation outgrows the context window)

- 🛠️ Allows **customizing much of the bot's [configuration](./docs/configuration/README.md)** at runtime (using commands sent via chat)

- 👥 **Actively maintained** by the team at [etke.cc](https://etke.cc/)
