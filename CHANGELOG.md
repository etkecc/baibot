# (2025-02-27) Version 1.5.0

- (**Feature**) Add support for sending Speech-to-Text replies for [Transcribe-only mode](./docs/features.md#transcribe-only-mode) as regular text messages instead of notices and doing it so by default ([a1bd292752](https://github.com/etkecc/baibot/commit/a1bd292752bdd37a196788c73d00b5619e843a78)) - improvement for [issue #14](https://github.com/etkecc/baibot/issues/14). See [ü¶ª Speech-to-Text / ü™Ñ Message Type for non-threaded only-transcribed messages](./docs/configuration/speech-to-text.md#-message-type-for-non-threaded-only-transcribed-messages) for details.

- (**Feature**) Add config setting controlling if a self-introduction message is posted after joining a room ([c051da2f4a](https://github.com/etkecc/baibot/commit/c051da2f4a161de0974ebb917f7a52d01f5a001f)) - fixes [issue #32](https://github.com/etkecc/baibot/issues/32). You may wish to add a `room.post_join_self_introduction_enabled` property to your configuration. See the [sample config](./etc/app/config.yml.dist) for details. If unspecified, it defaults to `true` anyway which preserves the old behavior.

- (**Feature**) Add support for configuring `max_completion_tokens` for OpenAI ([47d8edea70](https://github.com/etkecc/baibot/commit/47d8edea705a44aa25a9bfaec4888c0f9ea8700e))

- (**Improvement**) Dependency updates. This version is based on [mxlink](https://crates.io/crates/mxlink)@1.6.1 (which is based on the newly released [matrix-sdk](https://crates.io/crates/matrix-sdk)@[0.10.0](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/releases/tag/matrix-sdk-0.10.0))

- (**Improvement**) Populate image/audio attachment `body` with a filename, not with text to avoid incorrect rendering in Element Web, etc. ([ec1879d212](https://github.com/etkecc/baibot/commit/ec1879d212fa8d6e5f8590486e94c72abfcb75a5))

- (**Improvement**) Replace Anthropic library ([anthropic-rs](https://crates.io/crates/anthropic-rs) -> [anthropic](https://crates.io/crates/anthropic)) and switch default recommended model (`claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620` -> `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219`) ([692d61b239](https://github.com/etkecc/baibot/commit/692d61b2398f073b81d32d4cbe8145ab3929e48c)) - fixes [issue #22](https://github.com/etkecc/baibot/issues/22)

- (**Internal Improvement**) Switch to native building of `arm64` container images to decrease total build times from ~40 minutes to ~8 minutes ([6719538530b](https://github.com/etkecc/baibot/commit/6719538530bf76b3ff2d24077b2a7fa868276b79))

- (**Internal Improvement**) Various other internal changes, including upgrading [Rust from 1.82 to 1.85 and switching to Rust edition 2024](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/02/20/Rust-1.85.0.html)


# (2024-12-12) Version 1.4.1

- (**Bugfix**) Fix detection for whether the bot is the last member in a room, to avoid incorrectly leaving multi-user rooms that have had at least one person `leave` ([3c47d40781](https://github.com/etkecc/baibot/commit/3c47d407819aa9c0121117a411858238724f06da))


# (2024-11-19) Version 1.4.0

- (**Improvement**) Dependency updates. This version is based on [mxlink](https://crates.io/crates/mxlink)@1.4.0 (which is based on the newly released [matrix-sdk](https://crates.io/crates/matrix-sdk)@[0.8.0](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/releases/tag/matrix-sdk-0.8.0)). Once you run this version at least once and your matrix-sdk datastore gets upgraded to the new schema, **you will not be able to downgrade to older baibot versions** (based on the older matrix-sdk), unless you start with an empty datastore.

- (**Bugfix**) Add missing typing notices sending functionality while generating images ([9d166e35ba](https://github.com/etkecc/baibot/commit/9d166e35ba6fc0daaf69318870e92436f3302056))

- (**Feature**) Support for [Matrix authenticated media](https://matrix.org/docs/spec-guides/authed-media-servers/), thanks to upgrading [mxlink](https://crates.io/crates/mxlink) / [matrix-sdk](https://crates.io/crates/matrix-sdk) - fixes [issue #12](https://github.com/etkecc/baibot/issues/12)


# (2024-11-12) Version 1.3.2

Dependency updates.


# (2024-10-03) Version 1.3.1

- (**Improvement**) Improves fallback user mentions support for old clients (like Element iOS) which use the bot's display name (not its full Matrix User ID). ([d9a045a5e4](https://github.com/etkecc/baibot/commit/d9a045a5e41d2b99694f92ec9e90f47529546d89))


# (2024-10-03) Version 1.3.0

**TLDR**: you can now use OpenAI's [o1](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/o1) models, benefit from [prompt caching](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-caching) and mention the bot again from old clients lacking proper [user mentions support](https://spec.matrix.org/latest/client-server-api/#user-and-room-mentions) (like Element iOS).

- (**Feature**) Introduces a new `baibot_conversation_start_time_utc` [prompt variable](./docs/configuration/text-generation.md#Ô∏è-prompt-override) which is not a moving target (like the `baibot_now_utc` variable) and allows [prompt caching](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-caching) to work. All default/sample configs have been adjusted to make use of this new variable, but users need to adjust your existing dynamically-created agents to start using it. ([85e66406dc](https://github.com/etkecc/baibot/commit/85e66406dc6f430741c7819f420e2df4ae6e8d3b))

- (**Improvement**) Allows for the `max_response_tokens` configuration value for the [OpenAI provider](./docs/providers.md#openai) to be set to `null` to allow [o1](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/o1) models (which do not support `max_response_tokens`) to be used. See the new o1 sample config [here](./docs/sample-provider-configs/openai-o1.yml). ([db9422740c](https://github.com/etkecc/baibot/commit/db9422740ceca32956d9628b6326b8be206344e2))

- (**Improvement**) Switches the sample configs for the [OpenAI provider](./docs/providers.md#openai) to point to the `gpt-4o` model, which since 2024-10-02 is the same as the `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` model. We previously explicitly pointed the bot to the `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` model, because it was much better (longer context window). Now that `gpt-4o` points to the same powerful model, we don't need to pin its version anymore. Existing users may wish to adjust their configuration to match. ([90fbad5b64](https://github.com/etkecc/baibot/commit/90fbad5b643cd06c23179f055a309ec6a7cba161))

- (**Bugfix**) Restores fallback user mentions support (via regular text, not via the [user mentions spec](https://spec.matrix.org/latest/client-server-api/#user-and-room-mentions)) to allow certain old clients (like Element iOS) to be able to mention the bot again. Support for this was intentionally removed recently (in [v1.2.0](#2024-10-01-version-120)), but it turned out to be too early to do this. ([b40226826f](https://github.com/etkecc/baibot/commit/b40226826fe914d0d5d265230ebc5bac8058b6f7))


# (2024-10-01) Version 1.2.0

- (**Feature**) Adds support for [on-demand involvement](./docs/features.md#on-demand-involvement) of the bot (via mention) in arbitrary threads and reply chains ([9908512968](https://github.com/etkecc/baibot/commit/990851296828168c2106eb3f4668833e9e5a7463)) - fixes [issue #15](https://github.com/etkecc/baibot/issues/15)

- (**Improvement**) Simplifies [Transcribe-only mode](./docs/features.md#transcribe-only-mode) reply format (removing `> ü¶ª` prefixing) to allow easier forwarding, etc. ([e6aa956423](https://github.com/etkecc/baibot/commit/e6aa95642376ee7d87932d0e66dcfedf261b188b)) - fixes [issue #14](https://github.com/etkecc/baibot/issues/14)

- (**Bugfix**) Fixes speech-to-text replies rendering incorrectly in certain clients, due to them confusing our old reply format with [fallback for rich replies](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.11/client-server-api/#fallbacks-for-rich-replies) ([e6aa956423](https://github.com/etkecc/baibot/commit/e6aa95642376ee7d87932d0e66dcfedf261b188b)) - fixes [issue #17](https://github.com/etkecc/baibot/issues/17)


# (2024-09-22) Version 1.1.1

- (**Bugfix**) Fix thread messages being lost due to lack of pagination support ([d4ddd29660](https://github.com/etkecc/baibot/commit/d4ddd29660d9f51d248119dd6032e68ab29e7d35)) - fixes [issue #13](https://github.com/etkecc/baibot/issues/13)

- (**Bugfix**) Fix Anthropic conversations getting stuck when being impatient and sending multiple consecutive messages ([8b12bdf2b3](https://github.com/etkecc/baibot/commit/8b12bdf2b3196abea0e8db33d7c50fff48341cb9)) - fixes [issue #13](https://github.com/etkecc/baibot/issues/13)


# (2024-09-21) Version 1.1.0

- (**Feature**) Adds support for [prompt variables](./docs/configuration/text-generation.md#Ô∏è-prompt-override) (date/time, bot name, model id) ([2a5a2d6a4d](https://github.com/etkecc/baibot/commit/2a5a2d6a4dbf5fd7cb504ac07d4187fdc32ae395)) - fixes [issue #10](https://github.com/etkecc/baibot/issues/10)

- (**Improvement**) [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) changes to produce ~20MB smaller container images ([354063abb7](https://github.com/etkecc/baibot/commit/354063abb79035069bd3b26c53214874e9cdd95d))

- (**Improvement**) [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) changes to optimize local (debug) runs in a container ([c8c5e0e540](https://github.com/etkecc/baibot/commit/c8c5e0e540ab981e849452eb3ddb0378105e1fc6))

- (**Improvement**) CI changes to try and work around multi-arch image issues like [this one](https://github.com/etkecc/baibot/issues/2) ([5de7559ed6](https://github.com/etkecc/baibot/commit/5de7559ed685a41c22dfc12283681f02f4c2ee00))

Improvements to:

- messages sent by the bot - better onboarding flow, especially when no agents have been created yet
- documentation pages


# (2024-09-14) Version 1.0.5

Further [improves](https://github.com/etkecc/baibot/commit/3b25b92a81a05ebaf1c6dbabf675fbfbe6c9f418) the typing notification logic, so that it tolerates edge cases better.


# (2024-09-14) Version 1.0.4

[Improves](https://github.com/etkecc/baibot/commit/dd1dd78312e3db7f92b37fb3b4750fbe35de7115) the typing notification logic.


# (2024-09-13) Version 1.0.3

Contains [fixes](https://github.com/etkecc/rust-mxlink/commit/f339fc85e69aa7f614394ad303d1614cd307319c) for [some](https://github.com/etkecc/baibot/issues/1) startup failures caused by partial initialization (errors during startup).
