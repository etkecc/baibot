  encryption:
    # An optional passphrase to use for backing up and recovering the bot's encryption keys.
    # You can use any string here.
    #
    # If set to null, the recovery module will not be used and losing your session/database (see persistence)
    # will mean you lose access to old messages in encrypted room.
    #
    # Changing this subsequently will also cause you to lose access to old messages in encrypted rooms.
    # If you really need to change this:
    # - Set `encryption_recovery_reset_allowed` to `true` and adjust the passphrase
    # - Remove your session file and database (see persistence)
    # - Restart the bot
    # - Then restore `encryption_recovery_reset_allowed` to `false` to prevent accidental resets in the future
